# Missions of Love 🐦

A daily kindness suggestion system, channeling a child's simple perspective on making the world better.

## What is it?

**Missions of Love** is a simple Python script that provides a daily "mission" – a small, child-like act of kindness. The mission is the same for everyone on any given day, creating a shared global action.

## How it Works

The script uses the current date as a seed to randomly select a mission. This ensures everyone gets the same suggestion on the same day.

## Usage

```bash
python missions.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
--- 🕊️ HIBA's Daily Mission of Love ---

Go give a small piece of bread or some water to a bird today.
