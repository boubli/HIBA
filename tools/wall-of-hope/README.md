# Wall of Hope 🌟

A community-powered gallery where shared stories glow like stars in the night sky.

## What is it?

The **Wall of Hope** is an interactive web page that displays messages of hope and resilience from the HIBA community. Each story is rendered as a floating "hope particle" that gently drifts across the screen, creating a collective visual of shared light.

## How it Works

1.  Users submit their stories via the "Join the Collective Memory" tab in the main HIBA app.
2.  Approved stories are added to the `user_stories.jsonl` file.
3.  The `hope.html` page reads these stories and displays them as animated cards.

## Files

-   `docs/hope.html`: The main HTML page for the gallery.
-   `docs/style.css`: Shared styles for the HIBA website.

## Future Plans

-   Dynamically load stories from a backend API.
-   Allow users to "like" a story, making it glow brighter.
