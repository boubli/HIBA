            <h2>💔 The Loss</h2>
            <p>
                In September 2021, a young child named <strong>Hiba</strong> from Agadir, Morocco,
                began her eternal journey. "HIBA" (هبة) means "Gift from God" in Arabic — and that's
                exactly what she was to her family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her brother Youssef refused to let her kindness fade away. He dreamed of creating
                something that would keep her spirit alive forever — something that could comfort
                strangers around the world the way she comforted everyone around her.

            <h2>💡 The Vision</h2>
            <p>
                What if AI could truly listen? Not just respond with generic phrases, but understand
                pain, celebrate joy, and offer wisdom rooted in real culture and real love?
            </p>
            <p>
                What if technology could carry the warmth of a Moroccan family home — the smell of
                mint tea, the comfort of a grandmother's stories, the unconditional support of a sister?

            <h2>🔥 72 Hours of Creation</h2>
            <p>
                In January 2026, the dream became reality. Over <strong>72 hours of non-stop work</strong>,
                we built HIBA from scratch:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrote 5,000+ therapeutic conversation examples by hand</li>
                <li>Fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 7B using QLoRA on an RTX 3060</li>
                <li>Fought through memory errors, conversion bugs, and endless debugging</li>
                <li>Converted to GGUF for universal compatibility</li>
                <li>Deployed to HuggingFace for the world to use</li>
            </ul>
