# HIBA - A Gift from God AI 🕊️ (Roadcamp)

> "He who has a sibling has a treasure, and he who has a soul has infinity."

Welcome to the **HIBA Roadcamp**. This project is the public heart of the HIBA AI mission. It combines a live, reasoning-enhanced demo with a detailed roadmap of our journey from a small village in Morocco to a global therapeutic soul.
